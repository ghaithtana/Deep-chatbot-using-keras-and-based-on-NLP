How to run the code :
please:
1-download all the .py files and the model.h5 file and put them inside one folder
2-download the dataset from my google drive and but the dataset folder inside the project direcotry
3-but the model "model..x.h5" in a folder called Saved_models_checkpoints create one if it not
exists with the same name
4-open the project main drectory in PYcharm or other ide and then Run Chatbot_Gui .py 
Enjoy!
